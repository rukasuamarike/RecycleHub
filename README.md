# RecycleHub
 
## **Inspiration** 💡

Over the years, as the importance of recycling and the spread of awareness regarding the reduction of pollution, waste, and the incentive to reduce waste has grown, we wanted to take this opportunity to take another step forward. Through **ReHub**, an interactive web app, we believe people will be more incentivized to recycle.  

## **Features and Highlights** 🔧
 
One of the major features of **Rehub** is the leaderboard chart. 
-Account creation and participation within the leaderboard. 
-Accessing google maps to find the nearest recycling center. 

## **How we built it** 🏗️

We decided to use **Flutter** to design our front end. Since Flutter allows for easy development for iOS, Android, and the Web, it is essential to be able to communicate and spread awareness of the importance of recycling. We were able to utilize **Firebase** for our backend as it acts as an important database tool to help manage users and their requests and authentication.  

## **What we learned** 📚

Some of the things we were able to learn throughout the project were the, 
-limitation & realistic -> can't control the progress of the production in terms of implementing point system dependency within the recycling center. 
-utilizing skills/technologies that we've had previously used, to perform and create this project. 
-creativeness within the leaderboard and account creation.  

## **What's next ?**🔮

We believe that **ReHub* can be scaled to a bigger scale and be incorporated within many Recycling centers while acting as a quick and reliable resource for anyone to recycle more. Some additional features such as the ability to provide the user the most optimal distance to the nearest distance as well as ...Also, identifying and receiving data on recycling centers outside of SCU to provide accurate google maps info for users.
